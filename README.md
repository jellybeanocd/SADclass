System Analysis design class I took at SNHU
The clent for this project is called DriverPass. They wanted a system to help people increase their chances of passing their test by supplying them with online courses, practice tests, and on-the-road training. It needed to be cross-platform so it can be accessed through phones, tablets, and pc. I feel like all around I did fairly well, especially with explaining what the client needed, but my UML diagrams could use some work. I just need to slow down and put more information in them. I did a basic idea but in the real world I would need to have every detail in these diagrams so that the rest of my team knows what I intend on doing with it. With all of the diagrams and the document I included all of the information that I could to ensure that we include all parts of what the client wanted. This is important so everybody on the team knows what needs to be done and can build the best program for the client. If the user doesn't get what they need then the project isn't finished and you didn't complete your job. That's not exactly a way to keep clients. The most important thing is to make sure that the communication between your team and the client is open to ensure that the client has the system they want.
